## Purpose

ReCiter is a highly accurate system for guessing which publications in PubMed a given person has authored. ReCiter includes a Java application, a DynamoDB-hosted database, and a set of RESTful microservices which collectively allow institutions to maintain accurate and up-to-date author publication lists for thousands of people. This software is optimized for disambiguating authorship in PubMed and, optionally, Scopus.

ReCiter accurately identifies articles, including those at previous affiliations, by a given person. It does this by leveraging institutionally maintained identity data (e.g., departments, relationships, email addresses, year of degree, etc.) With the more complete and efficient searches that result from combining these types of data, you can save time and your institution can be more productive. If you run ReCiter daily, you can ensure that the desired users are the first to learn when a new publication has appeared in PubMed. 

ReCiter is fast. It uses an advanced multi-threading strategy known as a [work stealing pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) to make up to 10 retrieval requests at a time.

ReCiter is freely available and open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).  

Please see the [ReCiter wiki](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki) for more information.

## Technical 

### Prerequisites
- Java 11
- Latest version of Maven. To install Maven navigate to the directory where ReCiter will be installed, execute `brew install maven` and then `mvn clean install`

If you want to use Java 8 then update `<java.version>1.8</java.version>` in [pom.xml](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/blob/a3d5d4665e8692853ca69f2db0caba0eb56f557d/pom.xml#L49)

It is not necessary to install ReCiter in order to use the API.

### Technological stack
Key technologies include:
- ReCiter stores data about researchers and publications in **DynamoDB**, which can be hosted on Amazon AWS or installed locally.
- Its main computation logic is written in **Java**.
- It employs the **Spring Framework**, a Java-based application framework designed to manage RESTful web services and server requests.
- ReCiter uses **Swagger**, a toolset that provides a user interface with helpful cues for how to interact with the application's RESTful APIs. 


You may choose to run ReCiter on either:
- **A server** - ReCiter will run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows versions 7 and higher. A minimum of 4GB of RAM is required; 16GB of RAM are recommended. An Internet connection is required to download article data from scholarly databases.
- **A local machine** - ReCiter's APIs may be run in a browser on any modern machine. The ReCiter server must be accessible to the local machine via a local area network or internet connection.

### Architecture

![https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/blob/master/files/ArchitecturalDiagram-NEW.png](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/blob/master/files/ArchitecturalDiagram-NEW.png)


### Related code repositories

The ReCiter application depends on the following separate GitHub-hosted repositories:

- **[PubMed Retrieval Tool](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-PubMed-Retrieval-Tool)**
- **[Scopus Retrieval Tool](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Scopus-Retrieval-Tool)** (optional)
- **Data models:**
  - [ReCiter-Identity-Model](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Identity-Model)
  - [ReCiter-Scopus-Model](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Scopus-Model)
  - [ReCiter-Article-Model](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Article-Model)
  - [ReCiter-Dynamodb-Model](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Dynamodb-Model)
  - [ReCiter-PubMed-Model](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-PubMed-Model)

Optionally, users can install:
- [ReCiter Publication Manager](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Publication-Manager) - a powerful user interface / web application that streamlines the process of updating and reporting on the publications of an institution's scholars
- [ReCiterDB](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiterDB) - the back end data store for Publication Manager; in addition to the schema and stored procedures, this repository contains a set of scripts that retrieve data from ReCiter and imports them into this MySQL database


## Installation

ReCiter can be installed to run locally or in AWS via a cloud formation template. A required dependency is the [PubMed Retrieval Tool](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-PubMed-Retrieval-Tool/). The [Scopus Retrieval Tool](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Scopus-Retrieval-Tool/) is optional, but can improve overall accuracy by several percent. 

### Local

1. Clone the repository to a local folder using `git clone https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter.git`
2. Go to the folder where the repository has been cloned and navigate to src/main/resources/application.properties and change port and log location accordingly
- change `aws.DynamoDb.local=false` to `aws.DynamoDb.local=true`
- update location of DynamoDB database, e.g., `aws.DynamoDb.local.dbpath=/Users/Paul/Documents/ReCiter/dynamodb_local_latest`
- By default application security is turned on. If you wish to turn it off you must change the flag to false from `spring.security.enabled=true` to `spring.security.enabled=false`
- If you have the security as true you must include the following environment variables - 
```
export ADMIN_API_KEY=<api-key>
export CONSUMER_API_KEY=<api-key>
```
- If you do not have scopus subscription you should mark this value to false. Change `use.scopus.articles=true` to `use.scopus.articles=false`.
3. Enter ports for server and services in command line. Note that the Scopus service is optional. You must have [Pubmed Service](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-PubMed-Retrieval-Tool/) and optionally [Scopus Service](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Scopus-Retrieval-Tool/) setup before this step. Enter appropriate hostname and the port numbers.
```
export SERVER_PORT=5000
export SCOPUS_SERVICE=http://localhost:5001
export PUBMED_SERVICE=http://localhost:5002
```
4. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`. You can add additional options if you want like max and min java memory with `export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m`
5. Go to `http://localhost:<port-number>/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:<port-number>/swagger-ui/` (shorthand swagger url)  to test and run any API.


### Amazon AWS

The [ReCiter CDK](
https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-CDK) allows to install the entire infrastructure for ReCiter and its components and its highly configurable. There you will find instruction to install ReCiter and its components.




## Configuration

- **[PubMed API key](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-PubMed-Retrieval-Tool/blob/master/README.md#configuring-the-api-key)** - Recommended for performance reasons and to prevent and limit the likelihood National Library of Medicine will throttle you, but otherwise not necessary.  
- **[Scopus API key and instoken](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-Scopus-Retrieval-Tool/blob/master/README.md#configuring-api-key)** - Use of Scopus is optional. It can improve overall accuracy by several percent; Scopus is helpful because it has disambiguated organizational affiliation and verbose first name, especially for earlier articles. Use of the Scopus API is available only for Scopus subscribers. 
- **[Security](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/Implementing-security)** - Each of ReCiter's APIs can be configured to restrict access to only those requests which provide the correct API key.
- **[Application.properties](https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter/wiki/Configuring-application.properties)** - All remaining configurations are stored here.
